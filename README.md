# million-playlists-song-extractor
This project is for extracting information from the [spotify million playlist dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge#dataset)

There is no database of spotify IDs to use in data projects. This project aims to fix this.

[Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.21.0/#license) was used to create this project.
